{"name":"REDPy","tagline":"Repeating Earthquake Detector (Python)","body":"![REDPy Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahotovec/REDPyAlpha/master/img/logo.png)\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nREDPy (Repeating Earthquake Detector in Python) is a tool for automated detection and analysis of repeating earthquakes in continuous data. It works without any previous assumptions of what repeating seismicity looks like (that is, does not require a template event). Repeating earthquakes are clustered into \"families\" via the OPTICS ([Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm)) algorithm, with distance defined by cross-correlation. All data, including waveforms, are stored in an HDF5 table using [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nREDPy runs on Python 2.7, and currently has the following major package dependencies:  \r\n[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) | [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) | [matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org/) | [obspy](http://www.obspy.org/) | [pytables](http://www.pytables.org/) | [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) | [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/) \r\n\r\nMost of these dependencies can be easily installed via [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/) on the command line:  \r\n`>> conda install -c obspy obspy`  \r\n`>> conda install pytables pandas bokeh`\r\n\r\nHowever, due to a 'feature' in numpy 1.10.0, processing runs _extremely_ slow (by at least an order of magnitude, if not two or more). Until a fix is released for this issue in numpy, we recommend downgrading numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pytables to the following previously stable versions:  \r\n`>> conda install numpy=1.9.3 scipy=0.15.0 matplotlib=1.4.2 pytables=3.2.0 pandas=0.16.0 bokeh=0.9.3`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nOnce dependencies are installed and REDPy is downloaded, REDPy can be run out of the box with the following commands to test if the code is working on your computer:  \r\n`>> python initialize.py`  \r\n`>> python catfill.py mshcat.csv`  \r\n`>> python backfill.py -s 2004-09-15 -e 2004-09-24`\r\n\r\nCheck out the Wiki for more detailed usage!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
