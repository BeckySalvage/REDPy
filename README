This is the repository of the first stab at REDPy.

Currently, we're working on developing objects and methods to handle
the data with a brute-force approach, then scaling it after that.

Current list of major package dependencies:
numpy | scipy | matplotlib | obspy | pytables

Should work with an install of Anaconda for Python 2.7 and:
conda install -c obspy obspy
conda install pytables
