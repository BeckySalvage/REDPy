This is the repository of the first stab at REDPy.

Currently, we're working on developing objects and methods to handle
the data with a brute-force approach, then scaling it after that.

Current list of major package dependencies:
numpy | scipy | matplotlib | obspy | pytables

Should work with an install of Anaconda for Python 2.7 and:
conda install -c obspy obspy
conda install pytables

Run in this order:
initialize.py - initial set up of hdf5 table
backfill.py - backfill table between a given start and end date
makeplots.py - output plots

Optional:
single.py - fill table with last N seconds (default 3600 s, 1 hour),
    designed to be run as a cron job every N seconds
