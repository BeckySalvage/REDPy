###### RUN PARAMETERS ######

# Describe the run - this will be used in the title of the webpages and master plot title
title=REDPy Catalog
# groupName may not have spaces, corresponds to folder where outputs are stored
groupName=default
# filename must end in .h5
filename=redpytable.h5
# Amount of days to keep orphans in the queue based on size before permanent deletion
minorph=0.05
maxorph=7.
# nsec should be the maximum amount of time you want to process at once (in seconds)
# This depends on how much data your computer can hold in memory
nsec=3600


###### STATION PARAMETERS ######

# Number of stations
nsta=8
# List of stations in order of storage preference, NO SPACES
station=SEP,YEL,HSR,SHW,EDM,STD,JUN,SOS
# List of channels, etc., one per station even if they're all the same
channel=EHZ,EHZ,EHZ,EHZ,EHZ,EHZ,EHZ,EHZ
network=UW,UW,UW,UW,UW,UW,UW,UW
location=--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--
# Sampling rate to store all waveforms at (will resample if data do not match)
samprate=100.
# Bandpass filter (Hz)
fmin=1.
fmax=10.
# Frequency Index windows (should be within bounds of filtering above)
# Please note that these settings are ALSO used for teleseism filtering (below); if you
# change these from the default you will likely need to change 'telefi' or change
# 'teleok' to the same value as 'nsta' if you do not want to exclude teleseisms.
# FI lower bounds
filomin=1.
filomax=2.5
# FI upper bounds
fiupmin=5.
fiupmax=10.


###### DATA SOURCE ######

# Server accepts any FDSN web service that has waveforms (see obspy.clients.fdsn for full
# list). It may also be a waveserver (e.g., mazama.ess.washington.edu), SAC, or miniSEED.
# If using SAC or miniSEED, please be sure your headers EXACLTY match what you use for the
# SCNL above, as this is what I use to associate station information and not the filename.
server=IRIS
# Port is only necessary if using a waveserver
port=16017
# If using SAC files, define the path to the top directory where they exist, ending in /
# Also, ensure all of your filenames end with either .SAC or .sac
# If there are files in any subdirectories within this directory, they will be found
sacdir=./
# Same with miniSEED
# Also, ensure all of your filenames end in .mseed
mseeddir=./


###### TRIGGERING SETTINGS ######

# How many stations need to be triggered in order to be considered using a coincidence
# trigger? I like using just over half of nsta. Using less allows more triggers through,
# but that may not be real events or are of dubious quality. Requiring all stations to
# trigger is not advised unless you have 100% uptime on all stations.
nstaC=5
# STALTA trigger settings for long and short windows
lwin=8.
swin=0.7
# Higher trigon will reduce number of triggers, but may miss small events
trigon=3.
# trigoff should be slightly less than trigon
trigoff=2.
# Optional time offset
# Accepts a list (in same order as stations) of positive numbers corresponding to number
# of seconds to move the trace to the left. The way I think of this is as a list of
# arrival times of waves from an expected location. Can be used to quickly assess whether
# an event of interest is located near a known point (e.g., beneath the summit of a
# volcano or near the main shock in an aftershock sequence), or to bring arrivals from
# distant stations to be within a short correlation window. Be aware that the trigger time
# listed in the catalog will also be offset by the smallest value given. If used, should
# have values for each station. If not used, can just be 0.
# Example for default Mount St. Helens network might be:
# offset=0.00,0.17,0.49,0.60,0.50,0.82,1.09,1.05
offset=0


### CROSS-CORRELATION PARAMETERS ###

# Cross-correlation window length (in samples, 2^n is best)
winlen=1024
# Minimum correlation coefficient to be considered a repeater
cmin=0.7
# Number of stations this value must be exceeded on to be counted as a repeater. Like
# nstaC, I like to use about half. 
ncor=4


### PLOTTING PARAMETERS ###

# Station number to use for plotting cores & amplitudes, beginning at 0, in station list
printsta=2
# Minimum number of members within a family needed to appear on the timeline plot
minplot=5
# Width (in days) of bins for histogram subplot (default is 1 day)
dybin=1
# Width (in hours) of bins for histogram subplot on 'recent' timeline (default is 1 hour)
hrbin=1.
# Number of days prior to last repeater to show on 'recent' timeline (default is 2 weeks)
recplot=14. 
# Print a more verbose version of the catalog
verbosecatalog=False


### CHECK COMCAT FOR MATCHES ###
# If used, will search the ANSS Comprehensive Catalog for potential located seismicity
# that has arrival times consistent with the trigger time of repeaters, and if found,
# will write those matches to the end of the family HTML file with a map if at least one
# match is local to the study area. This can be time consuming for very large families!
# If the location of interest is in Northern California, it will also check NCEDC for
# located seismicity that may not have made it to ComCat.
checkComCat=False
# Station latitudes and longitudes (can also be a single value near the center of your
# network, here these match the stations above)
stalats=46.200210,46.209550,46.174280,46.193470,46.197170,46.237610,46.147060,46.243860

# Seconds of error allowable to be considered a match
serr = 5.
# Distance in degrees to search for local matches
locdeg = 0.5
# Distance in degrees to search for regional matches
regdeg = 2.
# Minimum magnitude to allow for regional matches
regmag = 2.5
# Minimum magnitude to allow for teleseismic matches
telemag = 4.5


### AUTOMATED SPIKE AND TELESEISM REMOVAL ###
# Spikes, harmonic noise, and teleseisms are automatically put into the 'junk' table and
# never considered as a repeater if they exceed the following thresholds. You can view the
# contents of this table with the plotJunk.py helper script and experiment with settings
# that might be more appropriate for your data. So far these settings have done well at
# not throwing away too many real events and not letting too many bad triggers through.  
# Kurtosis of waveform in a window: ~80-100 is appropriate for 5 s window, ~130 for 15 s,
# and ~200 for 25 s
kurtwin=5.
kurtmax=80.
# Kurtosis of amplitude spectrum to eliminate calibration pulses with unnaturally harmonic
# signals--be careful not to set too low or you could eliminate real harmonic events
kurtfmax=150.
# Maximum ratio of outliers to total number of datapoints in trace
oratiomax=0.15
# Teleseisms are filtered based on frequency index (uses above settings)
# Some tests with the default windows suggest that using a cutoff of -1.0 on
# multiple stations should catch a decent number of teleseisms without throwing
# out too many local LF events
# Frequency index minimum threshold (above this is OK)
telefi = -1.0
# Number of stations allowed to pass that exceed threshold
teleok = 2
